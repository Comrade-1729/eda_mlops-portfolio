    "# 🌍 EDA + MLOps Portfolio Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Context\n",
    "Modern public policy and business decisions increasingly rely on data-driven\n",
    "insights. However, many analytics projects fail not due to lack of models,\n",
    "but due to poor problem framing, weak exploratory analysis, and\n",
    "non-reproducible workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This portfolio addresses that gap by demonstrating **structured, production-aware\n",
    "exploratory data analysis (EDA)** across critical societal domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Portfolio Matters\n",
    "- Policy decisions often rely on incomplete or poorly interpreted data\n",
    "- Early-stage EDA determines downstream model quality and trust\n",
    "- Reproducibility and clarity are essential in high-stakes environments\n",
    "\n",
    "This portfolio focuses on **decision-support analytics**, not just visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analytical Scope\n",
    "The portfolio covers four high-impact domains:\n",
    "- 🌱 Climate & Local Environment\n",
    "- 🏥 Health Inequality\n",
    "- 💰 Economic Inequality & Digital Divide\n",
    "- 🚨 Crime, Accidents & Disaster Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Each domain is analyzed independently using real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is Being Demonstrated\n",
    "- Problem-first analytical thinking\n",
    "- Clean, modular data handling\n",
    "- Bias-aware aggregation and interpretation \n",
    "- Policy- and business-relevant insights\n",
    "- A foundation suitable for scaling into ML pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools & Technical Stack\n",
    "- Python (Pandas, NumPy)\n",
    "- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly\n",
    "- Scikit-learn (regression, preprocessing)\n",
    "- MLflow (lightweight experiment tracking)\n",
    "- Modular project structure with version control\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcome\n",
    "A senior-level exploratory analytics portfolio suitable for:\n",
    "- Data Analyst\n",
    "- Business Analyst\n",
    "- Junior Data Scientist\n",
    "- Policy / Research-oriented analytics roles"
